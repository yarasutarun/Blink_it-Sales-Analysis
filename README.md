•	Month-over-Month (MoM) Sales: Sales fluctuate seasonally, with some months experiencing higher sales growth due to promotions or increased demand.  
### 2. Outlet Performance Insights
•	Supermarkets generate the highest sales, outperforming small grocery stores.  
•	Older outlets (established earlier) tend to have higher sales, likely due to brand loyalty and customer trust.  
•	Medium and Large-sized outlets contribute more revenue compared to smaller stores.  
### 3. Category-Wise Sales Analysis
•	Frozen Foods & Dairy are among the top-selling categories.  
•	Low Fat vs. Regular Products: No significant sales difference was observed, indicating equal customer preference.  
### 4. Location-Based Sales Trends
•	Urban outlets have the highest sales, followed by suburban and rural locations.  
•	Sales in rural outlets are lower, possibly due to lower demand or limited product variety.  
### 5. Customer Behaviour Insights
